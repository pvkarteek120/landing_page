                    <p>Most of the people of Vizag don't know that Bullayya college also provides engineering courses. Since it is famous for a degree and PG, most of the top companies visited here for placements of degree and PG. None of the companies visited here for the engineering course. So in future, I think even engineering students would get good placements. Apart from that, most of the students got placed through off-campus drives. Bullayya college gives you lots of knowledge and also fun</p>
